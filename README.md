## rqst.io

Need to test your webpage form? Send your `HTTP POST` request to `http://rqst.io/params`:

```html
<form action="http://rqst.io/params" method="post">
```
Each request generates an 'application/json' content-type response and a JSON object payload consisting of attribute-value pairs corresponding to your form's name-value pairs.

The service is backed by the [Heroku infrastructure](https://www.heroku.com) and monitored regularly to ensure reliability.
